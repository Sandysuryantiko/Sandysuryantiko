Hi there 👋 I'm a junior tech enthusiast with a mix of skills in **IT Support**, **UI Design**, and **Web Development**.

💡 I enjoy solving tech problems, designing clean interfaces, and turning concepts into working code.  
🌱 Currently learning modern tools and frameworks to level up my dev game.  
🤝 Open to collaborations, learning, or just tech talk!  
🎨 Pixel-perfect design meets functional code – that’s my jam.  

Let's connect and build something cool! 🚀
